Technical writing is an extremely wide umbrella. Technical writing conferences are few and far between, and they only have so much time for a limited number of talks. Also, the range of possible attendees is few.

Tech Writing Talks aims to expand the horizons of what's possible. We want to give more speakers opportunities to share fun, interesting, or thought-provoking talks. We want to make talks available for people who might just be curious about technical writing, but who wouldn't necessarily attend a conference. And we want to make it possible for folks to give and watch talks who can't or won't attend conferences.
