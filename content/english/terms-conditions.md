#### Responsibility of Contributors

If you pitch a talk to Tech Writing Talks, you are responsible for guaranteeing that you own the copyright to the content of your talk. You certify that you are not providing incorrect or private information. Tech Writing Talks takes no responsibility for your talk content, or any consequences that may arise from your sharing of this content.

#### Content Ownership

You own all rights to any content you share through Tech Writing Talks.

#### A Pitch is Not a Contract

Pitching a talk to Tech Writing Talks does not constitute a contract. At any point during the pitch process, up until the final acceptance of your talk video and materials, Tech Writing Talks reserves the right to reject your talk. If your talk meets our acceptance policies, and we schedule and publish your talk, we agree to send you an honorarium in the amount of $100 USD, minus any fees imposed by the method of transfer. This honorarium does not constitute payment or a work-for-hire; it is a token of appreciation for the ideas you are sharing.

#### Tech Writing Talks Logos, Slides, and Name

Tech Writing Talks grants a temporary license to use our logos, slides, and name for the purpose of presenting a talk through our channel. You are permitted to promote your talk through your own social media channels using our logos, slides, and names. If you would like to distribute your talk through your own channels, you are welcome to do so, but may not use the Tech Writing Talks logos, slides, or name.
