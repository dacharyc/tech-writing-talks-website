Tech Writing Talks is a new initiative that aims to engage a diverse audience, including:

- Technical writers
- Managers of technical writers
- Developers who do a lot of writing as part of their jobs
- People who are curious about or interested in technical writing

We are not actively seeking sponsorship as we explore building the initiative. However, if you're interested in sponsoring Tech Writing Talks, we would be happy to hear from you. We don't have a prepared set of sponsor benefits or set sponsorship rates, but are happy to discuss possibilities, including:

- Adding "Sponsored by" placement within videos
- Sharing videos about your products or services
- Providing product placement in a dedicated area of the website
- Posting on our social media channels about your products or services
- Sharing job listings with our audience of engaged technical writing professionals

We intentionally do not maintain email lists or details about our audience members. We are unable to provide any sponsor benefits that would require us to maintain identifiable information on our audience.

If you're interested in sponsorship, send us a message through the contact form and select "I'd like to sponsor Tech Writing Talks" as the subject.
