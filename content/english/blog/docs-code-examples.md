If you write documentation for a product that is, itself, code - think SDK, API, or CLI - code is an important part of your documentation!

Take a whirlwind tour through:

- Why it's important to test code examples in docs
- How you might get started
- How you might level up your code example testing
- How my team tests, extracts, and transcludes code examples in our docs

## Audience
